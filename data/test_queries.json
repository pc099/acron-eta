However, grid infrastructure remained a bottleneck in many regions, with curtailment rates increasing in areas with high renewable penetration.

Fully remote employees showed a 7% productivity increase but reported higher rates of isolation and communication difficulties. Companies that invested in asynchronous communication tools saw 20% fewer meetings and 15% higher employee satisfaction scores.
